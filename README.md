# SmartHome Automation Project




## Overview
This project is a smart home automation system developed using NodeMCU and Arduino Mega. It enables users to control and monitor various home appliances remotely through a mobile application. Data synchronization and user authentication are managed using Firebase Realtime Database.
## Features
- Remote control of home appliances.
- Real-time monitoring and updates
- User authentication for secure access
- Mobile application interface
- Integration with Firebase Realtime Database
## Components
- **NodeMCU:** Acts as the main controller for connecting to Wi-Fi and communicating with the mobile app.
- **Arduino Mega:** Handles the control of multiple appliances and sensors.
- **Firebase Realtime Database:** Stores and synchronizes data between the mobile app and the hardware.
